Artist Statement

Ever since I was a young child, I have been obsessed with the integration of the human form on an abstract plane. The capacity to render subtle emotions, by using our own innate ability to mimic, coupled with a resonate wall of abstraction, to compare or contrast with the meaning found in the gestural narrative, presents a more complete argument.

With regard to my fine art, most of my concerns have been around the depiction of basic human emotions and situations: love, regret, pain, creation, destruction, doubt. The events in our life that we find had to express; these moments are what Fine Art should be about, no matter what is trending right now. In my world, Art is about inclusion and understanding.

To this point, I have never sought the sale of my artwork. For me, this seems like a futile endeavour. In fact, the creation of Art is so personal that, for me, to put a price tag on it would demean it.
